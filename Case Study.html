<h2>The Irish Famine Infographic</h2>
</div> 
    
<div id="cs2">
<div>
<p>The Irish Famine is arguably one of the most detrimental and tragic events to have ocurred in Irish History, causing and extreme population decline that we as an island are yet to recover from. This infographic investigates the causes of the famine, death/ emigration statistics and delves into what life was like before, during and after the famine in a cohesive timeline of events.</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
    
<p>In this project I was challenged to create an infographic that is based around population growth/decline or that could explore populations in specific countries/regions. As I have always been intrigued by Irish History, I decided to create an infographic on the Irish Famine. I wanted to ensure that all facts were as balanced and unbiased as possible as I knew how divisive and controversial certain points in Irish history were (particularly this one!)</p>

<h2>My Approach</h2>
    
<p>Before I began the design stage of my infographic, I needed to fully investigate and research the topic in order to educate myself to my best ability. I knew that I wanted to create a well organised timeline due to the sheer volume of information that I was putting across in order to aid understanding. After compiling all the information that I wanted to use, I began sketching rough ideas, layouts and potential structures so that the reader did not become confused, overwhelmed or lost.</p>

<h2>Obstacles Faced</h2>
    
<p>My biggest challenge in this project was deciding on ways to convey different statistics and facts in a way that was understandable to the user. In addition to this, I struggled in regards to layout as I didn&#39t want the information to feel too crushed or visually distracting. As I was making a timeline infographic, I wanted the viewer to feel like they were moving through time as they scrolled through the infographicand therefore had to ensure that the timeline itself wasn&#39t obstructed visually.</p>
</div>

</div>
    
<div id="cs7">
<h2>The Solution</h2>
    
<p>The final product was a well structured and informative timeline of events during The Irish Famine with well broken down statitics and figures using different methods of data visualisation. It starts off my showing what the Irish population was like pre-famine and slowly portrays the progressions of the famine and population decline/ emigration through time.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
    
<p>Upon reflection, I now can fully appreciate the importance of appropriate data visualisation in allowing us to digest and fully conceive information in ways that are visually interesting. It is a tool which can quickly break down information and allow the reader to fully grasp the scale of certain statistics. For these reasons, I believe its a tool that any UX Designer should know and understand in order to make information more easily understandable to all users reading it.</p>
