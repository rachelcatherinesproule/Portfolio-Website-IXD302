<h2>PlanIt: To Infinity and Beyond</h2>
</div> 
    
<div id="cs2">
<div> 
<p>PlanIt is the travel app of the future, designed to help you plan your inter planetary holiday by helping you to book flights, hotels and package deals. The app focuses on making holidays easy and quick to book while considering the user&#39s budget. This is done using considered icon and UI designs to let users easily navigate through the app interface.</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
    
<p>The challenge in this project was to create an illustrative travel app with a minimum of 3 screens. It had to be easily understandable and it had to improve a person&#39s travelling experience. I wanted to try something different by creating an inter planetary travel app as I thought it could be very interesting aesthetically. I wanted the illustrations to take precidence in my app as I thought it would help to set the scene of a futuristic reality. I based my overall app design around the Jetsons and retro futurism as I loved the colour scheme and overall style of design.</p>

<h2>My Approach</h2>
    
<p>When designing the app, I had to initially research other travel apps on the market and investigate the ways in which they designed their layout. As a designer, I had to consider what kind of things a person would book on a holiday, the price range, offers and promos etc. In order to solve this, I focused on presenting the most vital information to the user first.</p>

<h2>Obstacles Faced</h2>
    
<p>My biggest obstacle was restricting the sheer amount of information that I wanted to display to the user on screen. I also struggled to limit the amount of screens that I created as I wanted to consider every aspect of navigation within the app. Limiting my colour scheme to 3 colours proved to also be a challenge, as I needed to ensure that the app was as cohesive as possible.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
    
<p>Solving the issues that I was presented with was by no means easy, but after a lot of consideration and design refinement, I managed to create a product that was cohesive, easily navigated and visually pleasing.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
    
<p>Upon completing this project, I learned to appreciate the work and consideration that goes into creating an app with a considered UX Design. I feel that from creating an app, I learned to respect the use of minimalist design as it tended to make a much larger impact on the user. This project has really helped me to comprehend the work behind user experience design as I had to constantly explore how each screen would interact with one another and consider if the needs of the user were being met.</p>
