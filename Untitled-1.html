<h1> Infographic: The Irish Famine</h1>
<h2>An Gorta Mor</h2>
    
<p>The Irish Famine is arguably one of the most detrimental and tragic events to have ocurred in Irish History, causing and extreme population decline that we as an island are yet to recover from. This infographic investigates the causes of the famine, death/ emigration statistics and delves into what life was like before, during and after the famine in a cohesive timeline of events. </p>
    
<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Pencil</li>
<li>Paper</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
    
<p>In this project I was challenged to create an infographic that is based around population growth/decline or that could explore populations in specific countries/regions. As I have always been intrigued by Irish History, I decided to create an infographic on the Irish Famine. I wanted to ensure that all facts were as balanced and unbiased as possible as I knew how divisive and controversial certain points in Irish history were (particularly this one!) </p>
    
<h2>My Approach</h2>
    
<p>Before I began the design stage of my infographic, I needed to fully investigate and research the topic in order to educate myself to my best ability. I knew that I wanted to create a well organised timeline due to the sheer volume of information that I was putting across in order to aid understanding. After compiling all the information that I wanted to use, I began sketching rough ideas, layouts and potential structures so that the reader did not become confused, overwhelmed or lost.</p>
    
<h2>Obstacles Faced</h2>
    
<p>My biggest challenge in this project was deciding on ways to convey different statistics and facts in a way that was understandable to the user. In addition to this, I struggled in regards to layout as I didn't want the information to feel too crushed or visually distracting. As I was making a timeline infographic, I wanted the viewer to feel like they were moving through time as they scrolled through the infographicand therefore had to ensure that the timeline itself wasn't obstructed visually.</p>
    
<h2>The Solution</h2>
    
<p>The final product was a well structured and informative timeline of events during The Irish Famine with well broken down statitics and figures using different methods of data visualisation. It starts off my showing what the Irish population was like pre-famine and slowly portrays the progressions of the famine and population decline/ emigration through time.</p>
    
<h2>Reflection</h2>
    
<p>Upon reflection, I now can fully appreciate the importance of appropriate data visualisation in allowing us to digest and fully conceive information in ways that are visually interesting. It is a tool which can quickly break down information and allow the reader to fully grasp the scale of certain statistics. For these reasons, I believe its a tool that any UX Designer should know and understand in order to make information more easily understandable to all users reading it.</p>
    
<h1> My Personal Brand</h1>
<h2>Building my brand identity</h2>
    
<p>As a designer, it's incredibly important to ensure that you are portraying yourself and your brand in the best possible way. I therefore challenged myself to build my own personal brand and brand identity in a way that is reflective of my own personality as a designer and person.</p>
    
<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Photoshop</li>
<li>Pencil and Paper</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
    
<p>The challenge in this project was to create a personal brand that was reflective of my personality and could be used in both a casual and professional setting while still retaining an element of familiarity. The brand consisted of a monogram, wordmark, visual marque and single page website. A successful brand should really portray the person's personality traits in terms of tone, colour scheme and overall brand presentation. </p>
    
<h2>My Approach</h2>
    
<p>I already knew befre this project that I wanted to create a really fun and visually eye catching brand. I wanted the monogram to be minimalistic and reflect my professional side, while on the pther hand, I wanted my visual marque to be more characterful and vibrant. The wordmark I used was used to bridge these two ideas together in order to make a cohesive brand. Before sketching out ideas, I researched multiple example websites/brands and investigated their personal approach.</p>
    
<h2>The Solution</h2>
    
<p>I created a personal brand that I feel reflected my personality effectively through my choice of design and layout. The use of a limited and contrasting palette helped to make an eye catching product. My written style was personal ad reflective of the way in which I speak and communicate my work to others.</p>
    
<h2>Wordmark</h2>
    
<p>As I wanted to help bridge the gap between my style of visual marque and monogram, I aimed to reach a happy medium between all aspects. The end result was a typeface based on the Michroma typeface- one that I think is full of character due to its more geometric design, which nicely complimented my monogram.</p>
    
<h2>Monogram</h2>
    
<p>Although I would like my website and brand to be more casual and fun, I decided to go for a monogram that could be implimented in a more serious context i.e showing my brand to potential employers/clients. My monogram is a simple, geometric mark that combines my initials and reflects my professional style whilst retaining my brand's overall aesthetic.</p>
    
<h2>Visual Marque</h2>

<p>My own visual marque acted as the main personality filled aspect of my overall brand. I wanted to reflect a little bit of myself in the design by creating a duck design, as it was my childhood nickname given to me by my dad. I also have intertwined the idea of beizer points to represent my passion for design. Overall, I'm really satisfied with the marque's outcome as I feel that it's a good and accurate depiction of me and my personality.</p>
    
<h2>Reflection</h2>
    
<p>Upon reflection, I have come to truly appreciate the importance of considerate brand design as it all comes together to portray your own character and creative ability to others through your own aesthetic choices. It's important to therefore consider every aspect of your brand and how you put yourself across.</p>
    
<p>I also have come to learn how essential it is to thoroughly consider a brand. There's a lot of planning, research and mindmapping in order to make something as important as a personal brand as everything you portray will be associated with you and your quality of work.</p>
    
<h1>PlanIt</h1>
<h2>To Infinity and Beyond!</h2>
    
<p>PlanIt is the travel app of the future, designed to help you plan your inter planetary holiday by helping you to book flights, hotels and package deals. The app focuses on making holidays easy and quick to book while considering the user's budget. This is done using considered icon and UI designs to let users easily navigate through the app interface.</p>
    
<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>Pencil and Paper</li>
<li>Invision</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
    
<p>The challenge in this project was to create an illustrative travel app with a minimum of 3 screens. It had to be easily understandable and it had to improve a person's travelling experience. I wanted to try something different by creating an inter planetary travel app as I thought it could be very interesting aesthetically. I wanted the illustrations to take precidence in my app as I thought it would help to set the scene of a futuristic reality. I based my overall app design around the Jetsons and retro futurism as I loved the colour scheme and overall style of design.</p>
    
<h2>My Approach</h2>
    
<p>When designing the app, I had to initially research other travel apps on the market and investigate the ways in which they designed their layout. As a designer, I had to consider what kind of things a person would book on a holiday, the price range, offers and promos etc. In order to solve this, I focused on presenting the most vital information to the user first. </p>
    
<h2>Obstacles</h2>
    
<p>My biggest obstacle was restricting the sheer amount of information that I wanted to display to the user on screen. I also struggled to limit the amount of screens that I created as I wanted to consider every aspect of navigation within the app. Limiting my colour scheme to 3 colours proved to also be a challenge, asI needed to ensure that the app was as cohesive as possible.</p>

    
<h2>The Solution</h2>
    
<p>Solving the issues that I was presented with was by no means easy, but after a lot of consideration and design refinement, I managed to create a product that was cohesive, easily navigated and visually pleasing.</p>
    
<h2>Reflection</h2>
    
<p>Upon completing this project, I learned to appreciate the work and consideration that goes into creating an app with a considered UX Design. I feel that from creating an app, I learned to respect the use of minimalist design as it tended to make a much larger impact on the user. This project has really helped me to comprehend the work behind user experience design as I had to constantly explore how each screen would interact with one another and consider if the needs of the user were being met.</p>
